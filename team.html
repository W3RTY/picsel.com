            I have always been curious about how the software, that I use, work. Ever since I learned how to code, I have participated in many projects, whether personal or for school. I have used many image processing software. Thanks to this project, I will learn how it works and create one myself. I'm excited to start working on this project with my group and I think I will learn many things while creating this software. I also hope to bring new knowledge to my group and also learn from them.

            Ever since I develop programs, I had many opportunities to manipulate images. First, through the creation of small independent games with graphical libraries, and later, with the very recent "OCR project". Moreover, I've always used softwares like Paint, even before I started to code. Therefore, I am already rather familiar with some of the tools (namely, the SDL library) we might use to develop PiCsel, our own software project. To sum up, the idea of developing this project gives me a lot of enthusiasm, and I also hope we are going to challenge ourselves, concerning the quality of the features added to the software.

            From the start of our Epita school curriculum, we already had multiples occasions to work on projects. I have always appreciated working in teams to create applications. I will learn more about programming and most importantly in handling images and files. Programming has always been my favourite part of our school curriculum and I will try my best to finish this project. This will be also the occasion to learn more about drawings.

            For the project of the 4th semester, we have planned to design a software capable of creation and manipulation of images. As this project affects many areas, it will allow me to deepen my knowledge and acquire new ones. Moreover, as this is a team project, I will also be able to refine my team work, which is essential in a company. I am aware that this project seems quite ambitious, but I intend to carry it out and provide results with quality.
